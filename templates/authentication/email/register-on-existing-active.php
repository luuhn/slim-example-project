    Hello <?= $user->getFullName() ?><br>
    <br>
    Someone tried to create an account with your email address. <br>
    <!-- Sentence defined for assertion in RegisterCaseProvider.php    -->
    If this was you, then you can login with your credentials by navigating to the
    <a href="<?= $route->fullUrlFor($uri,'login-page') ?>">login section</a> or if you forgot your
    password, you can reset it here. <br>
    <br><br>
    Best regards <br>
